## Codebase Patterns
- Use `parse_hf_uri` for Hugging Face URIs; it returns `HfUriParts` with repo/path/revision/repo_type and still unpacks as `(repo_id, path_in_repo)`.
## 2026-01-08 05:50:12 UTC - US-001
Session: 
- What was implemented: Added structured HF URI parsing (repo/path/revision/repo_type) and updated loaders/backends to consume revision/repo_type; added tests covering hf:// variants and backwards-compatible unpacking.
- Files changed: src/unibox/utils/utils.py, src/unibox/loaders/loader_router.py, src/unibox/loaders/hf_dataset_loader.py, src/unibox/backends/hf_hybrid_backend.py, tests/test_utils.py, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: `parse_hf_uri` now returns `HfUriParts` but still supports tuple-unpacking for repo/path.
  - Gotchas encountered: `make` and `pytest` were not available in this environment.
